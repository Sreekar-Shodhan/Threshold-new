triplets
-> rows
each row has country , year , indicator
max for indicator depending on type of indicator 


this indicator -> that value 
we use the triplet to get value for that particular indicato
then we can have multiple triplets 
at which time when that country became developed
take all countries -> then plot on a single line 1960-2025 -> In which year every country became developed 

indicator , value 
plot for that indicator 
whne tahts done we can take multipel of that sets 

after that choose by country and year 
plot the value of today -> china 1980 developed and current value is what rn? 

above works only for one indicator
